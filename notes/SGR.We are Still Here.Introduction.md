> American nonvoters are disproportionately younger, poorer, less educated,and more racially and ethnically diverse. People with lower levels of income and education are also less likely to contact a public official, join a civic and political organization, or donate to a political campaign. Moreover, instead of fostering solidarity, living through the Great Recession of 2008 actually deepened divisions among those fighting to survive, turning some white workers against racial minorities, immigrants, and the poor. pg 1-2

It seems that those who would most benefit from political mobilization are the ones who are least involved in politics. 

> steady blue-collar jobs, unions, marriage and extended kin networks, churches, social clubs, and political parties pg 2

These used to be places where workers would be able to get support to lessen personal struggles but now they are sites of betrayal.

>Convinced that democratic processes are rigged in favor of the wealthy,many working-class people search for meaning in internet conspiracy theories or the self-help industry—both of which are solitary strategies that serve to turn them inward or against each other. pg 3

Working class people look for ways to deal with the void left from previous institutions in self help and conspiracy theories.

Breek, a waitress in, Coal Brook talks about how she thinks the government should help out more, provide better programs for their kids and more opportunities. She also detests people who do things which make her "depressed community more depressed." There is a large drug problem in Coal Brook but Bree refuses to take part in it despite having chronic pain due to various assaults by previous husbands. 

The local doctor will give perscriptions for addictive medications like percocets to whoever wants them. It only costs 50 dollars. He does this even though there are huge problems with drug addiction and overdose.

Eric, Bree's boyfriend is a black man from South DC. He grew up in his father's girlfriends abusive house hold. He eventually whent to CPS and was put into many foster homes. He got into college for football, but was kicked out on charged of possessing heorin after his aunt died. He now has a job as a warehouse worker. 

He and Bree's daughter, with the last name lopez, face extreme racism. The cops, the judges and the whole system is very corrupt because they're all friends and so no one has to take accountability. Bree and Eric cannot be very public with their relationship because it's looke down upon by the community. 

Bree and Eric have very different strategies towards dealing with this stress. Bree talks about unrelenting decay, but Eric alwasy speaks of the future and potential to do better. He thanks god for the opportunity to "better himself."

### Connection Between Politics and Experience

They both express disdain towards those who cannot overcome their circumstances to an extent: Bree talking about those who go on drugs instead of resisting the urge and Eric with regards to getting a job despite having felonies. But they both have some liberal values with regards to higher taxes on wealthy, more police oversight, critical of mass incarceration etc. 

#### Bree
She supports trump despite acknowledging his racism since she valeus the fact that she knows what she's getting with Trump. She says that Hilary is in the pocket of too many other people. Bree also brings up some ideas about how she doesn't think Hilary cannot make a rational decision because she didn't leave Bill Clinton after his sex scandal. But Bree would still take Bill Clinton over those two since "He's a slut. But he's a man." She views unfaithfulness as a fundemental quality of men that she is okay with. 

#### Eric
Eric has a deep distrust of the government and doesn't see a point in supporting any president. Because he feels the president isn't powerful enough to make real changes. "They have to go through people." He talks about using is smartphone to access "alternative" media sources feeling like if he isn't vigilant, the mainstream media will trick him. Eric is isolated and doesn't believe in democracy.

### Making Sense of Working Class Politics. 
Almost anyone can see the paradoxical nature of their political beliefs and their real life experiences. Really good quotes on pg 10. 

> In her groundbreaking study of dozens of political groups across the state of Wisconsin, Katherine Cramer argues that this quantitative approach allows us to see how different kinds of people think, and where their opinions fall on an attitude scale, but it does not allow us to see how they arrive at these positions. Rather, it is the stories people tell about who they are, what they have been through, and how their lives should have been that do the interpretive work of connecting independent and dependent variables. pg 10 - 11

Given certain environmental variables like income, race, etc, we can predict people's opinions. So what are the common stories that we tell ourselves for us all to arrive at certain opinions so predictably? Do we tell the same stories or do we construct different stories to lead ourselves to our conclusions?

We can study these stories to see how people select their values and experiences to build an argument for their political beliefs. **Many examples are listed on page 11**. This is in contrast to the conventional ideas of how voters cast their ballot: Weighing policy details to see which candidate will best serve their economic and social interests. Other theories suggest that people generally think about "how somone like me" should vote while casting their ballot, suggesting that people connect their identity to their politics much more than their experience. For example maybe a black business owner who would benefit more from republican policies votes democrat because he believes thats "how black people vote." 

### The Study

> If social class becomes the basis of a shared political identity, it is not simply an automatic response to sharing the same education level, income bracket, or job. Rather, class is something that “happens” through concrete social relationships that generate values, traditions, and shared interests in ways that cannot be assumed in advance. pg 12

<p style="color: red; font-weight: 900">What does this mean?</p>

The author follows this up by saying that the deep connection between labor and the democratic party during this times was not a function of class, because these people's class remained the same, yet their politics switched up, now favoring pro-business, anti-welfare politicians. This might be what she means when she says "class is something that 'happens'."

Fundementally This study is about using conversational interviews to understand how poor/working class people in Coal Brook relate their views of reality and their understanding of their experiences to their politics. In this study, we don't focus on what people are getting wrong about facts because this serves to diminish trust and is not very open-minded. Because regardless of what we think reality is, they have some view of reality and their politics is informed by that, so challening their reality will just make it harder to extract the reasoning and experiences which informs their political beliefs. 

And to question their view of reality and turn this into an argument is to be close minded and just servers to dominate these individuals and their experiences.

>There is no obvious, linear relationship between their socioeconomic status, gender, race, and political positions. They do not sound apathetic, passive, or unaware of what is happening around them. They are not single-issue voters who prioritize social issues such as abortion or gun control over economic interests, nor do they place themselves into clear-cut categories of Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative. Most of the time, as they attempt to come to terms with their past traumas and future anxieties, they do not think about politics at all. pg 14.

To an extent it seems like many people in these areas are so caught up in their personal struggles that it is ahrd to care or think about politics. 

### Connecting it All

>For the people in this book, the stable ties and roles that undergirded workingclass life in previous generations have similarly come undone. Detached from mainstream civic and political institutions, they view their social worlds as hostile and broken, leaving nothing larger than themselves to believe in. pg 16

The ties between peoplea are eroded and the pain that miners once shared and collectively alleviated through unions is now bestowed upon individuals instead of the collective. So people have to get through and process their pain by themselves. 

**pg 16** gives the broad strokes of how different people deal with the pain which they must now deal with themselves. 

The main take away is that these working class people take pride (? right word?) in the fact that they are bearing the brunt of their indivudal pains by themselves. They are united in their inward turn to help themselves rather than engaging with the collective. Survival through pain becomes a marker of the working class, a show of will power and individual strength through trying times.

> Gilens found that when the policy preferences of lowand middle-income Americans differed from the preferences of the affluent, there was no relationship between policy outcomes and the desires of less advantaged groups. However, the preferences of affluent Americans were significantly related to policy outcomes, regardless of whether their desires were shared by lower-income groups. pg 17

This is also interesting because they have divergin political beliefs from the affluent but if all the working class people would exercise the power of their vote, as a collective, they would surely have more sway as politicians would need their votes to stay in power. Maybe this is flawed thought though. For example, what politicians do during their term may be more influenced by their wealthier contituents who can donate to them while they are in office? But this decreases their longevity if the working class keeps them in check during election season.

**on pg 17** the author talks about similar things where politicians tend to respond to those who are more politically active. The working class does not have sustained political activity so their needs go unheard. It is hard to say it is the fault of the democratic system when the people refuse to participate in it.
