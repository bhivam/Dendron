> "Proponents of big data policing argue that incontrast to human discretion, algorithms and other automated data management systems reduce bias" pg 100 ^7fcg70ehbsjj

This does not account for the fact that these platforms are deployed in a preexisting organizational contexts and that the creators of these programs have biases as well. 

**Algorithms streamline human decisions, they do not get rid of human discrtion. They only obfuscate it.**

### Biases in Big Data Policing
- The data law enforcement chooses to collect.
- What methods of analysis used in the platforms and then their interpretation of this analysis.
- How it informs their practice.

#### **These are all social processes**

<br> <span style="color:blue">What dose the author mean by *social product and social resource*?</span>.

#### My Take:
Big data is not fundementally fair or unfair. Like a car or a gun it is another tool in the police's arsenal, nothing more. It is a very powerful tool, though, and, like with any other tool, if it is used carelessly or with mal-intent there will be bad consequences. 

#### Some Ways in Which Big data Reproduces Inequality
- "deepening the surveillance of inidivudals already under suscpicion
- "codifying a secondary surveillance netork"
- "widening the criminal justice dragnet unequally"
- "leading people to avoid 'surveilling' institutions that are fundemental to social integration"

## How Can Big Data Be Used to Reduce Inequality
### Policing the Police
If we can increase the surveillance of police, we can use the data we collect to generate insights, showing if there are any particular practices or patterns on an institutional level which create bias in policing. This will increase transparency and hopefully, accountability. 

### Lack of Police Data
We don't have things like databases on police killing or on race-police interactions on a national level

One effort to remedy this problem included the Obaba adminstration's creation of the Preesident's Task Force on 21st Century Policing and the Police Data Initiative which would crate a community of law enforcement agencies, technologist and researchers commited to using data to increase transparency and accountability and improve police-community relations

The Trump administration just this Task Force down in 2017. This means that we cannot rely on data which comes directly from the police or government. 

#### **Everyone Can Get Involved**
Many news organizations and nonprofits have set up data bases with information on police interactions and there are apps which allow citizens to record police interactions and upload them to the ACLU's database. pg 102


#### **LAPD TEAMS II**
The LAPD is ahead of curb because of their TEAMS II initiative. They believed that a large number of use of force complains came from a small group of officers, so if managers could preduct who those officers will be and intervene, these complaints could be reduced by a lot. 

#### What is TEAMS II?
This system compares peer groups of individuals grouped together based on equal standing based on qualities like assignment, rank and calssification. If the indivdiduals are more than standard deviations above th mea of their peer group on any action such as vehicle pursuits r use of force, they are flagged as a risk and their supervisors are notified. pg 103

TEAMS II is a good example of a system created with the purpose of monitoring the police, but often times even when we have systems in place we need people to use than and act upon them.

#### How we could be using Big data to Police the police
* For example, Palantir can track the reasons of officer gives for entering a particular query. This is tracked in an immuttable adit log for any time an officer is being investigated for some type of malpractice.
>Not one person [the athor] spoke with could identify a single instance in which a Palantir use audit had been conducted pg 103
  - This is because the LAPD doesn't want to use limited resourced performing audits. It's not a priority for them. 
* Another example is the AVLs. This in care tracking device can help supervisors measure the effctiveness of police presence and be used to make sure police officers are on track and that they aren't misusing their vehicle. We learned that this capability is turned off due to police unions


### Stop and Frisk
The NYPD had a stop and frisk policy where they could stop and frisk anyone they deem as being suspicious. They had high hit rates for whites, but low hit rates for blacks. This is because they would stop blacks very often because they were black and often not for any other reason. 
#### Potential Solution
We can use the simple heuristic of a 3 point system where officers check for suspicious noise, a large bulge, and a suspicious object. Depending on the point threshold in a particular area, they should stop someone and frisk them.
- For this to be effective and unbiased, this area specific threshold needs to be adjusted properly.

#### **Correcting for Incomplete Information**
>Therefore, if big data can be utilized to fill information gaps, it may improve police interaction with, in this instance, minorities, by creating new “priors” or pieces of data to be considered in subsequent interactions. This learning could allow police to rely less on racial stereotypes. pg 106

## Reinforcing Inequality through Big Data
Algorithms trained using Machine Learning techniques will use training data to find statistical relationships and patterns which can be packaged into a model which can use data points to generate an output.

The police's predictive algorithms use all types of input data on certain landmarks and locations, geo-tagged crime activity, et cetera, to get an output of who and where are high risk for crime. 

But if the training data is biased, the output when given new data will also be biases.

### Feedback Loops
LAPD's points system for prioritizing people to interacti with will give them a point when they are interacted with. So this feedback loop just makes initially suspicious people, more and more suspicious with no end in sight. It doesn't really help. 
- People who are in the system can never get out. They will always be in police suspicion.
