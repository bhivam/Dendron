This chapter centers around black and latino men who have moved into the coal region from the cit, disrupting the racial, urban-rural divide. They critique poverty and racism which shape their lives. They portray Coal Brook as a place where they can tranform their bad pasts into a good future for their children. They exaggerate the positive consequences of pain, citing traumatic experiences as pivotal moments of growth. They expect their fair share in terms of social inclusion and respect based on their tancity and hard work.

## Examples:

### Edwin Acosta
He is a Puerto Rican construction worker whose parents moved to New York before he was born and raised him in Newark, New Jersey. He describes his childhood as "having some hungry nights," but explaining that "it could have been a lot worse." His childhood neighborhood was rife with drugs and violence. 

His parents moved to the coal region to ge them out of the city. He completed high school and dropped out of a pharmaseutical program he was enrolled in. He took on 12,000 dollars in debt for that program. He fell behind on the payments between dropping out and getting into contruction, dropping his credit to 300. An old friend of his father's gave him a job in construction. He was able to live in the houses while he was renovating them and he got paid 24 dollars per hour with winters off. 

> “If they had any fuckin’ sense they’d be more with Hillary, you know what I mean?” he demands. “Cuz let Trump get the seat, half of you motherfuckers are going outta here. You broke bastards, you lazy sons of bitches, you’re all gone. All you guys that like to sit around and just wait for your check, you’re outta here, you know what I mean?” pg 96

He values hard work and thinks that if they want to continue their lazy, broke life styles collecting checks, Trump supporters should support Hillary.

He would rather stay inside when he is off work because he is often scrutinized and harassed because of his race. 

> I’ve been called a [n-word] several times out here. Yeah you can just tell, you know, you just feel the tension in the air. Everybody gets real quiet and you know, fathers are hugging their daughters all extra tight for some reason. pg 97

> Edwin feels most vulnerable when he is around white women, as every move he
makes comes under scrutiny pg 97

He has no trust for the criminal justice system, saying that all the police and the judges are friends with eachother. He has had experiences with cops putting him in prison for a few hours because they suspect that he possess drugs but let him go because he doesn't do anything wrong. He is critical of private prisons. 

He criticizes people who accuse newcomers of wanting to abuse welfare because if newcomers would eligible for welfare, why would they move the the coal region in the first place? Why woudldn't they stay in their subsidized housing? He says that most people move to the region because of how cheap it is. "top 5 cheapest places to live in america. 

He says that white poeple aren't so different form the newcomers. They too are just too poor to leave and they don't have any opportunities to do better for themselves. He says that they just like taking a jab at the newcomers because it gives them a sense of superiority to have a narritive which paints the newcomers as lazy welfare seekers. 

> He reports that by the time Obama ran for office, he had already completely given up on societal change and did not even vote. “Driving myself crazy with situations that I have no control over, is just brain-fucking yourself. I don’t set myself up for disappointment. When it comes to something that isn’t about me or my immediate family, just leave me out of it.” Thinking about his own life, he muses, “I’ve had times where I thought to myself like you know, if some big ass rock from the sky just came and landed on the town right now and just ended this shit, I would not be mad. But nothing that would make me like, ever felt like I’m gonna kill myself.” pg 99

### Andres

He is an american citizen but he reports being targeted because he's peurto rican. He's often stereotyped as Mexican. But he tries not to let it get to hi because he takes pride in his American citizenship. He is baffled that he can live in a country from the moment he's born but be alienated from it as if he's an outsider. 

He gets a lot of his value from his hardwork. He takes pride in the fact that he's the best worker at his Walmart. 

> “The presidents are selected not elected,” he shrugs. He focuses instead on his positive narrative of self-improvement and upward mobility for his family, which in his worldview negates the necessity of politics: “No matter how we put, no matter how you put it, we’re still doing way better than we was before. I could be a bum in the streets living outside and I’ll still doing better than I was.” pg 100

### Maloclm Wilkerson

When he was 17, his best friend got shot by a boy 2 years younger than them. It was this traumatic experience which made him realize that the has to get out of Philidelphia and do something with his life. pg 101

He moved to the coal region with 3 friends in order to find stable, cheap housing and a job. But on the second day of his Warehouse job, his car broke down and the four of them lost their jobs because they were half an hour late. “I mean granted, I could have been white and went through the same problem, but I feel like they didn’t really care because I was black." pg 101

He doesn't blame white people in coal brook for being racist, saying that they don't know any better because that's how they were raised. Opting for ignorance over maliciousness to explain their behaviour. Despite this Malcolm does not engage with racism and does not react to it. 

Malcolm explains that he voted for Obama in 2012, but that the feels too unknowledgeable to vote in 2016. He opted not to vote because "We didn’t have no class for that in school. Like to sit there and teach us exactly what a Democrat is, and what the purpose of all that is, we never had that in school" pg 101

He said that he doesn't feel patriotic and that while he respects veterans, he wouldn't fight in a war because he doesn't even know what their purpose is. 

Similar to others he said that its hard to get into politics when you don't like either option. There's no buy in. He instead opts to focus on his own life. He admires anyone that can do something positive in their life, work hard and express their passion through their work while making money from it. 

### George

He got into a lot of trouble as a kid and stopped going to school. He said that he was fed up and there was no one there to make sure that he went since his mom was often at work. He suffered many traumatic experiences, like being shot at in his house and the many fights he got into at a juvinille detention center where he was place from the ages 13 tp 17. He developed a distrust of government institutions during his tenure at the facility. 

Leaving the facility he didn't have much. He spent many of his formative years locked up without a real eduction. So he had to endure the transition into adulthood without any real skills. 

But George frames this traumatic experience in a positive light saying it was a pivot into the upward trajectory he has. He cites many mentorlike figure who convinced him not to waste his life away in "the system."

Once he got out he met his current girlfriend and earned his GED. His girlfriend got an office job but he was stuck getting work through temp agencies where the employers would fire him before he could get enough days to becoem a full-on employee. He got injured at one of his jobs and had to quit. Now he's a house husband. 

> Rather than compare himself to memories of a better past, George casts the future as something he can control, frames his negative experiences as learning opportunities, and affirms his worthy status as someone who does not quit. pg 105

> To opt out—to admit to not “giving a damn” as George states—allows him to focus solely on his own narrative of recovery and self-improvement, to leave the world and its baggage behind for a fresh start. His critiques of the forces that shapes his life go unvoiced. pg 106

### Jeffery

He grew with parents who were addicted to crack and learned to fend for himself at a very young age. His sister was taken in by a neighbor and his brother become a drug dealer and ran away at 15. He bounced around the foster system for a while. At first he was placed in a Christian white family. He did well, going to church and earning good grades in school. He was made fun of because he has cheap clothes and to protect his self respect, he would get into fights at school with the poeple who picked on him. He got kicked out and was put in a boy's home. 

Afer being put in a boy's home he met a staff member who was assigned to him Keith. Keith was like a father figure to him. Jeffery got out of the home at 17 and had earned his GED. He then worked for Keith's mom at her in-home daycare. 

Keith eventually was killed and this rocked Jeffery's life. He eventually got into dealing drugs because "he didn't want anyone else to die" so he would help his friends and said that he would be on the front line for them even if they were selling drugs. He went to prison, and got out on parole. Once he got out he moved out of philly so that he wouldn't get into any more trouble. 

> It was either I had to change my life, or somebody would kill me or I would be in jail for the rest of my life. I got to say if I wouldn’t have came out here, I think I wouldn’t have made it. I know I wouldn’t have made it cuz it’s just the area that I’m from. If I would have gone back there, them dudes is just crazy. Really, really crazy. I can’t deal with all that. pg 109

After getting off parole Jeffery moved to coal brook with his white girlfriend who has had family there for multiple generations. He built a respectable life in Coal Brook. 

He was fired from his job after he got into a fight with a server who calld him the n-word. She didn't want to apologize so he quit the job. 

> Previous research has found that black men embody a “caring self ” comprised of altruism, generosity toward a larger kinship network, and a commitment to working for social justice—a way of ascribing meaning to one’s life that stands in sharp contrast to the ethos of the self-made man. pg 110

> He “tears up” as he thinks about how opportunities will continue to improve for his daughter’s generation. But he also restricts the sphere of obligation to himself, his partner, and their child, retreating into a smaller, more manageable sphere of action in which he has some hope of creating a worthy, safe life. pg 110

> As the sociologist Corey Fields observes, while black Republicans are often accused of voting against both their racial and economic interests, this paradox disappears when they express their support for lower taxes and probusiness policies in a context of racial uplift.11 Furthermore, it is possible that the networks that sustain his sense of social inclusion, especially among “important” families in the coal region who are connected to his girlfriend and his former boss, make voting for Trump the reasonable and obvious choice. pg 110

Jeffery also says that after being on the internet and doing some reading he feels like there's a lot of string being pulled and a lot of puppets in the government. 

He then begins to talk about the illuminati and how everything is controlled because the simpsons had donald trump becoming president on their show. Very conspiratorial. 

### Rafael de Sousa

He is mistrustful of strangers and proud of his heritage and expresses it despite living in an environment where that might hurt him. 

He says that his parents were good people and that they taught him right but that he chose wrong because he needed to act like a savage to protect himself. He says that in Harrisburg, he needs to always be looking over his shoulder. To be hypervigilent and constantly project aggression and confidence to protect himself. 

He says that he didn't want that for his kids so he moved to coal brook. He explains that while in Harrisburg he was constantly scared for his children's lives.

He has been to prison multiple times and has many kids. On his last stay in prison he earned his GED and some certificates. The system promised him that he would be able to reintegrate into society, but despite trying his best in prison no one was willing to give him a chance when he got out. Instead he lives off social security from chronic pain and anxiety and feeds his children with food stamps.

> At first, when Rafael and his family arrived in Coal Brook, the stares of the white residents unnerved him. “Th ey’re trying to say, ‘Oh before y’all came up here, this town was peaceful.’ So before we came up here, all them overdoses ain’t been happening before we got here?” he scoff s. “It’s about to be 2017, and they’re still stuck in 1935. pg 115

He has given up on his life and says that he lives to give a better life for his children. Everything for him comes down to redemption through his children. 

> “I’m thirty- six and I feel, I feel like lost sometimes. And it’s, it’s just, I just worry about their future and what it holds for them because I’m done, I’m good. I’m just waiting now. Hit seventy or whatever, watch my grandchildren grow up. I’m just waiting now. I’m done. You know it’s sad to say that at thirty- six years old, but you know what? I’m good where I’m at. I love the world, but it doesn’t love me back.” 

## Take Away

Overall it seems like young men in Coal Brook put a lot of value into their hard work and self efficacy. They view Coal Brook as an opportunity for a new start where they can propel themselves through their own willfulness and hard work. Coal Brook has more safety, jobs, and affordible housing than the cities these men come from. 

They don't rely on the government viewing political change as a lost cause. Instead, they focus on improving their immediate surrouding through their own power. 

These men go through a lot of adversity due to their poverty stricken backgrounds and beacuse of the norms of the neighborhoods they group up in. Despite this they end up in Coal Brook, fighting for a better future, viewing their past as motivation to do better.
