### Example of Cops Escaping Surveilence
Officer Ramirez had to type an address into his computer manually even though his police cruiser, like every other, has an automatic vehicle locater. They would ping the location of every LAPD vehicle every 5 seconds, but due to resistence from the police unions, they are all off. **pg 75**

## Summary
The power and resistance to surveilance is a function of the broader context of where it is employed. Police officers might have a different reaction to surveillance because of their relationship to the police department as employees. We see in the above example that the AVLs are turned off due to the union's (workers') desire to not be surveilled. Employers have a lot of information on their employees make it easy to deskill officers, create more efficient processes which alienate the officers (or remove a need for them), and remove more agency from them. **pg 76**

## Employees and Surveilance
Worker behaviour is made legible to management through the process of processing quantitative and qualititative descriptions of the worker's on-the-job activities. The extent to which incurs, marks the depth of the entrenchment of manageerial control through electronic surveillance. **pg 76**

## Function Creep
"Some technologies, they explain, are introduced with the explicit purpose of monitoring workers. But many more are introduced to perform other functions and only incidentally afford managers the ability to surveil workers." **pg 77**

This is Function Creep. The idea that by introducing tech with new functionality which has a side effect of collecting some data, we can start to deepen the extent to which we surveil or are surveiled

## Occupational Identity and Cultural Context
Often, when the worker's occupational identity or cultural context is encroached on, they will be more eager to resist. 
>"For example, truck drivers, like police officers, often view independence, or being “out on the open road,” as a central tenet of their occupational identity, so they have contested and resisted electronic logs that put them under increased surveillance" **pg 77**

So it is obvious that police, who often value their sense of independence/authority and have a lot of camraderie, will feel attacked as a group and as individuals when they are surveiled

The two more potent predictors for the reactions to the introductin of new big data analytics are one's level in the organizational hierarchy and their function.

## Politics of Pinging 
One captain explained that hew knew officers would be weary of being individually tracked and micro managed and that this leads him to advocate for AVL data analysis on an aggregate level, to better deploy and locate officers in case of an emergenc and to analyze the AVL data, police presence, against crime in particular areas. **pg 79**
### Officer Reactions
> “The way I see it, they know where I’m at at all times.” She continued, “The fastest way to get fired is lying. If your log says you’re here and GPS says you’re there, you’re lying.” **pg 79**

There is a lot of hysteria. Officers will speculate and start "rumormongering" about the new technology because they are personally uncomfortable with it.
- Often times, officers will believe that these tools are already being used by management and that management was lying about not using it.
