This chapter is about how the realization of a declining American dream presents itself to the working class and how that connects to their political beliefs. 

## The Lorino Family
This will be about a white working class family experiencing a steep decline in their status, feeling ashamed and dissapointed in themselves and in their fellow working class whites.

### Antonio Lorino
Antonio Lorino lived through the rise and fall of the working class white. He lived at a time when America was dominating the world in manufactoruing, where the government enforced tarriffs and trade polocies which protected workers and unions. But as work was computerized and manufacturing was sent overseas, the value of minimum wage fell and the American working class white was in free fall. 

>The rise of neoliberalism from the 1970s onward shifted the burden of risk away from the government and back to individuals and families, jettisoning protections for workers in favor of the free movement of capital and trade. In place of collective economic rights, we have witnessed a renewed celebration of the self-made man, with short-term profits for stakeholders taking precedence over loyalty, sustainability, or broadly shared prosperity for workers. pg 20


#### Antonio Positions
- Antonio fought in the Vietnam war and now lives off pension he gets for life due to injuries he suffered. Despite this he laments that his daughter ended up the way she did because the government promises handouts instead of opportunities. 
- Antonio is vehemently anti big business because he thinks that the endless pursuit of profit has taken the soul out of people, reducing them into a means for production. 
- He thinks that everyone should have a job and that jobs give people purpose. 

###### Side Note:
Progressives during the 1960s alienated many blue-collared democrats becuause they would advocate against the war and for environmental policies while they recieved college defferments from concription and their nice white collar jobs were safe from the environmental regulations which put American industries at a disadvantage. Antonio is a part of the many Vietnam war veterans who came back to be calling baby killers for fighting in a war which they weren't even properly informed about. 
- He also thinks that "republicans are for rich people"
- But he supports a billionaire trump despite all this because he thinks that someone as rich as trump won't be influenced by political donations and that he "has a head on his shoulders" because he went to wharton school of business.

### Joyce Lorino

Joyce has memories of her coal miner father being denied compensation for the black lung he suffered from. These early interactions instilled in her an indictment of greedy politicians and corporations. 

She mainly focuses on economic freedoms and equalities. She believes that politicians are consistently paid off by corporate lobbyists to do their bidding.

She is in a greuling battle for custody of her grand daughter. Her daughter is an addict and she feels that her daughter isn't fit to raise her grand daughter. Especially since she provides and pays for her grand daughter so much.

Joyce feels like she can't do anything about wall street corruption, but that one's own struggles are something that they can fight through to improve themselves. 

When she is asked to justify her vote for Trump she cites the concentration of political and coporate power/corruption saying that Trump has the money to avoid this and that he's honest because he is not a career politician. 

Interestingly her second choice is a very progressive pro-labor senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders. 

It is interesting that many working class people do not divide their politics around partisan lines. It is also good to note that both Trump and Bernie Sanders are populists.

### Tori Lorino
Tori, the source of the family's greivances, was going to birth a child in 3 months. She went to a for profit college for cosmetology but they taught her very outdated stuff, so to her the degree was useless even though it put her 16000 dollars in debt to acquire. She tried to take an opporutnity, but she was unable to. Kind of contrary to what her parents were saying about her. 

Tori was not interested in politics at all and mainly spoke about her past traumas and how she has dealt with them. Her mother was never warm towards her and never really mothered her. She was raped and when she confided in Joyce, Joyce just told her that she came back after curfew often and that it was her fault that she was raped. 
- This kind of points to the acceptance among working class women that they have to be the ones to be responsible for the actions of the men around them and that they cannot trust men to be decent. Similar to Bree's point of view.

Tori says that after years of trying to deal with her ADHD, depression and trauma she has found ways to deal with it and accept herself by journaling, being open with people about it and going on ADHD and depression medication.
