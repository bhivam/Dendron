#### Core Beliefs:
> People are entitled to whatever capabilities are necessary to enable them to avoid or escape entanglement in oppressive social relationships.

I think this it is very important to be clear about what we mean by oppresive social relationships. I feel like this is a very subjective thing so there needs to be a careful definition before this can be applied. 

> They are entitled to the capabilities necessary for functioning as an equal citizen in a democratic state

In public interactions you should expect to be treated as anyone else would be. Foe example in a city hall type of situation, everyone's thought sshould have equal weight. 

Either society shouldn't care about certain differences between citizens or they should provide an easy way for citizens to acquire the qualities to get equal treatment.
