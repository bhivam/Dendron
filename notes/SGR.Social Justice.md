### Equality
- It is important to think about what needs to be equal. Equality is not inherently important. 

### David Smidtz

#### Justice as a Neighborhood
- Different places in a neighborhood have different contexts where justice is applied differently.
- Depending on the context different elements of justice can be drawn upon. 
- If we apply the same element of justice no matter what the situation, we will run into situations which we feel are unjust
